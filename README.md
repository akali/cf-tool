## Installation

You can download the pre-compiled binary file in [here](https://github.com/xalanq/cf-tool/releases).

Or you can compile it from the source (go >= 1.12):

```plain
$ git clone https://github.com/xalanq/cf-tool
$ cd cf-tool
$ go build -ldflags "-s -w" cf.go
```

## Usage

Let's simulate a competition.

 `cf race 1136` 

To start competing the contest 1136! The id 1136 can be found in the contest URL. 

e.g. <https://codeforces.com/contest/1136>

If the contest has not started yet, `cf` will count down. If the contest have started or the countdown ends, `cf` will use the default browser to open dashboard's page and problems' page, and fetch all samples to the local.

 `cd 1136/a` 

Enter the directory of problem A, the directory should contain all samples of the problem.

 `cf gen` 

Generate a code with the default template. The filename of the code is problem id by default.

 `vim a.cpp` 

Use Vim to write the code (It depends on yourself).

 `cf test` 

Compile and test all samples.

 `cf submit` 

Submit the code.

 `cf list` 

List problems' stats of the contest.

 `cf stand` 

Open the standings' page of the contest.

Download handles list

 `cf handles`

## Template Example

The placeholders inside the template will be replaced with the corresponding content when you run `cf gen`.

```

$%D%$   Day    (e.g. 09)
$%h%$   Hour   (e.g. 08)
$%m%$   Minute (e.g. 05)

## FAQ

### I double click the program but it doesn't work

Codeforces Tool is a command-line tool. You should run it in terminal.

### I cannot use `cf` command

You should put the `cf` program to a path (e.g. `/usr/bin/` in Linux) which has been added to system environment variable PATH.

Or just google "how to add a path to system environment variable PATH".

### How to add a new testcase

Create two extra testcase files `inK.txt` and `ansK.txt` (K is a string with 0~9).

### Enable tab completion in terminal

Use this [Infinidat/infi.docopt_completion](https://github.com/Infinidat/infi.docopt_completion).

Note: If there is a new version released (especially a new command added), you should run `docopt-completion cf` again.
